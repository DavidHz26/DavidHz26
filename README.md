# 👋 Hi! My name is David Hernández

## I'm a Junior Video Game and Software Developer.

During my career I have developed/participated in some video games in events called GameJams from my University. <br> 
I have always been an autodidact and I like to learn new things to improve my coding skills.
I'm currently practicing Data Structures so I can improve my coding and problem-solving skills.
