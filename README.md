# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is David HernÃ¡ndez

## I'm a Junior Video Game and Software Developer.

During my career I have developed/participated in some video games in events called GameJams from my University. <br> 
<br>
I have always been an autodidact and I like to learn new things to improve my coding skills. <br>
<br>
I'm currently practicing Data Structures so I can improve my coding and problem-solving skills.
