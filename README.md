# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is David HernÃ¡ndez

## I'm a Junior Video Game and Software Developer.

During my career I have developed/participated in some video games in events called GameJams from my University.
I have always been an autodidact. I learned Java at a intermediate level by looking for some courses online.
I'm currently practicing Data Structures so I can improve my coding skills and problem resolution.
