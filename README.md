# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is David HernÃ¡ndez

## I'm a Video Game and Software Developer Junior.

During my career I have developed/participated in some video games (in events called GameJams organized by my University, Personal Projects and University Projects). <br> 
<br>
I have always been an autodidact and I like to learn new things to improve my coding skills and share things I learned in case it becomes helpful to someone else. <br>
<br>
I'm currently practicing Data Structures to improve my code practices and problem-solving skills.
